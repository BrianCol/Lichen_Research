# Lichen_Research
Before you start using this repository, please read the following. 

## The files
There are 3 files ‘csv’ files that contain all the data. They are genbank.csv, tle.csv, and working.csv. As denoted by their names, each file corresponds to either the genbank data, tle data or the working data. There are also 3 R scripts intended to produce graphs of either the world destiny or the United States destiny for each ‘csv’ file. The R scripts are genbank_graphs.R, tle_graphs.R, working_graphs.R. Each R script has two functions that will produce a jpg saved to wherever dictionary—also known as a file—you have cloned the github repository into. The functions in the R scripts are gen_world_map and gen_states_map for the genbank.csv, tle_world_map and tle_states_map for the tle.csv, and working_world_map and working_states_map for the working.csv. You can click on the “view code” button the see the raw R code. 

## How to move forward
Now that you know what the 'csv' files, R scripts, and functions are, you will now need to know how to implement them. First off, you need to access them through github.
If you have a Apple computer or a computer running on Linux, you’ll need you open your terminal. Go to your search bar and type terminal. For those using Windows, I would recommend downloading gitbash for your computer. Gitbash performs like a Linux terminal, but it can run on a Windows operating system. There are other options including WSL, virutal box, and others. You may look into this other options you desire to.
